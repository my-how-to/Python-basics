Cover all topics required for the PCEP exam in a clean, review-friendly structure.
Advanced Python topics and PCAP-level material live in a separate repository.

## Exam Notes

Last updated: 2026-01-11

PCEP exam questions often include caveats and hidden traps. This is good, since if you can detect them you reqaly uderstand the question. My goal is to pass within 2 tries.  
Course completion took about 2 months alongside day-to-day activities, and I keep discovering new question traps.  
That means I expect another ~2 months of practice and review using this repo, plus ongoing updates.
The official pre-PCEP course alone is not enough to pass the exam.
This is my personal conclusion and may not be true for others.
Also, I'd like to know what percentage of exam takers used a voucher on their first attempt; I estimate it at around 30%.
